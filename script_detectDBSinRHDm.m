% script to correlate TDT-generated DBS pulse times with detection of
% digital line in rhd files


% load relevant TDT data

% load relevant RHD single-channel data


%detect square-wave pulses in rhd digital line
% use statelevels to get started
% detect rise times


% TDT-RHD correlation
% correlate stim to RHD detections
% go from time in TDT to time in RHD, then samples in RHD

% output samples in .mat file for later loading in artifact viewer
